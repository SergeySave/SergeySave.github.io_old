# sergeysave.github.io

This is my website generator and GitHub pages archive.
Running `com.sergeysav.website.Main.kt` will clear and regenerate 
the `docs` folder with my website. Pages can be added and removed from
the generator by adding them in the `Main.kt` file.

This isn't too exciting, mostly a quick and easy port of my old website
which used Spring so it needed a webserver. This, on the other hand, simply
generates and links bunch of `html` files together and to other resource files.
